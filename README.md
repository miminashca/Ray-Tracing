# Ray-Tracing
CMGT Rendering‑Techniques TTT — Ray tracing (custom C#/HLSL implementation) vs Unity’s built‑in Rendering pipeline. 
 
It measures how a custom Ray Tracer scales compared with Unity’s built‑in Rendering pipeline while the mesh compexity increases, accounting:

* GPU & CPU frame time
* Image quality
